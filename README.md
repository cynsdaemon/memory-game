# Memory Game
--------

This repo serves as a home for the 'Memory Game' project in the Udacity [Frontend Web Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) Nanodegree.

Instructions
--------

The live project is available [here](https://cynsdaemon.github.io/memory-game/). A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled is required. No other dependencies are necessary to run this game.

**To play:** A deck is made up of 16 cards. All cards have a matching pair hidden somewhere in the deck. The game and the game's timer starts when a player begins clicking on a card to flip it open. Each opened pair counts as a single move. The less moves a player makes, the greater their final star rating :star: :star: :star: will be.  Find all matching pairs to win the game! :sunglasses:
